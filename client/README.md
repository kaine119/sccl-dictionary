# Dictionary Client

The client needs to have â‰¥3 main screens:
- Search dialogue
- Definition
- OCR camera thing
- (maybe) a search results screen?

(optional? idk) Also, the client needs to do some caching, and other things to pass Google's [Lighthouse audit tool for PWAs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lightouse). Some of the fancier stuff (splash screens, 3G performance, NoScript support) we can do without for now, but it should _at least_ cache the app shell and prompt to install to home screen.
